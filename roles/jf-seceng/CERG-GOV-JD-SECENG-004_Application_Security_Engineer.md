## 9. Competency Expectations by Grade

Competency expectations for this role follow the Engineering pillar behavioral anchors from [CMP-001]. Each cell describes observable behavior demonstrating the competency at that grade. Anchors are cumulative: an L3 expectation includes the L1 and L2 anchors.

| Competency Domain (CMP-001) | L1 Expectation | L2 Expectation | L3 Expectation | L4 Expectation |
|-----------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Technical Depth | Executes assigned engineering tasks (IaC module, configuration change, architecture review checklist item) from established procedures. Recognizes when a task result does not match expected output and escalates with context. Learning the organization's technology stack: can name the major platforms, their purpose, and their security control points. | Owns a technology domain (e.g., AWS security, Azure AD, Kubernetes admission control). Designs and implements security controls independently within that domain. Performs architecture reviews in their domain and produces findings that require minimal rework from the reviewer. Authors and improves procedures for their domain. | Shapes the organization's technical security strategy in their domain. Designs reference architectures adopted by other engineers. Anticipates how changes in the technology stack will affect security posture before they land. Performs architecture reviews across domains with credibility. | Sets the technical bar for the entire Engineering pillar. Called upon for the hardest cross-domain problems.

| Risk Judgment | Follows the risk taxonomy when documenting findings. Can distinguish between a configuration drift alert that needs a ticket and one that needs an incident response page. | Independently assesses the severity and likelihood of findings in their domain. Assigns risk ratings that are consistent with the taxonomy and rarely adjusted by a senior reviewer. | Evaluates risk across domains and articulates the business impact in terms an executive can act on. Identifies compensating controls that reduce risk below what a pure vulnerability score would suggest. | Shapes the organization's risk appetite through technical judgment. Called upon by the CISO for independent risk assessments on material decisions. Their risk evaluation carries the same weight as a pillar leader's. |
| Communication | Writes clear ticket updates and status reports.

Writes the organization's public technical positions. Represents the organization at conferences and in industry working groups. |
| Operational Discipline | Follows procedures correctly. Updates tickets and documentation when work is complete. Meets assigned SLAs. Admits when they do not know something rather than guessing. | Owns operational SLAs for their domain work streams. Ensures evidence is collected and stored per the evidence procedure. Improves procedures when they find gaps. Their work is consistently auditable without retroactive cleanup. | Designs procedures that are operationally sustainable, not just technically correct. Ensures the evidence trail for their domain is audit-ready at all times. Identifies and eliminates toil: automates repetitive operational tasks. | Sets operational standards for the pillar. Defines what "good" looks like for procedure compliance, evidence quality, and SLA management. Holds the pillar accountable to its own operational commitments. |
| Influence and Mentorship | Actively learns from senior engineers. Asks good questions. Shares what they learn with peers. | Onboards new Specialists without assistance. Peer-reviews code and configurations with constructive feedback. Their technical opinion is sought by other engineers in their domain. | Mentors Specialists and Sr. Specialists across domains. Leads technical initiatives without formal authority. Their architectural recommendations are rarely overruled. | Shapes the development of the entire Engineering team. Sets the technical bar through their own work and their mentoring. Influences hiring profiles, team composition, and organizational design. |
| Compliance and Regulatory Literacy | Knows which regulatory frameworks apply to their organization. Can describe the security implications of the major ones (NERC-CIP, CMMC, SOX) at a high level. | Understands the specific regulatory requirements that affect their domain. Can explain to an auditor how a control they implemented satisfies a regulatory requirement. | Anticipates regulatory implications of engineering decisions. Advises project teams on compliance requirements before design is complete.

## 10. Success Profile

An Application Security Engineer is successful when security is a natural, frictionless part of the software development lifecycle. Key indicators: SAST/DAST/SCA tools are integrated into CI/CD pipelines with low false-positive rates; findings from security reviews are fixed before deployment, not tracked as technical debt; developers seek security input early in the design phase; the mean time to remediate a critical application vulnerability is measured in hours, not days. The engineer makes it easier to build securely than to cut corners.

## 11. Career Path

### 11.1 Within-Family Progression

Within JF-SECENG, progression follows the Security Engineering level ladder in [JF-001 §9.1](../CERG-GOV-JF-001_Job_Families_Overview.md#91-jf-seceng--security-engineering-levels): L1 Associate Engineer/S1, L2 Engineer/S2, L3 Senior or Staff Engineer/S3, and L4 Principal Engineer/S4. Promotion evidence should show increasing autonomy in secure design and implementation, ownership of engineering work streams, authorship or improvement of standards and reference architectures, cross-pillar influence, and mentoring of less experienced engineers. The grade definitions and progression dimensions are maintained in [JA-001 §4](../../governance/CERG-GOV-JA-001_Job_Architecture_and_Grade_Framework.md#4-sme-progression-grade-definitions).

---

### 11.2 Cross-Family Movement

Cross-family movement options are defined in the [Family-to-Family Career Lattice (JF-001 §4)](../CERG-GOV-JF-001_Job_Families_Overview.md#4-family-to-family-career-lattice). The Left-Right Knowledge Model ([FRM-001 §9.2](../../governance/CERG-GOV-FRM-001_CERG_Framework.md)) and cross-training expectations ([OM-001 §10.4](../../governance/CERG-GOV-OM-001_CERG_Operating_Model.md)) operationalize cross-family career movement.

### 11.3 Management Track Option

At L3+ (SME track), a Management track option may be available per [JA-001 §8.1] (SME to Management Transition). Readiness indicators include: consistently sought out for guidance by junior team members, leading cross-functional initiatives without formal authority, and communicating clearly with non-technical stakeholders. The transition is a track change, not a grade promotion — an S3 Advisor moving to M1 Manager carries their technical credibility into the management role. Management competencies are defined in [CMP-001 §7]. See [JA-001 §5] for Management grade definitions (M1-M4) and §9 (Span of Control and Team Design) for when to create a management role.
