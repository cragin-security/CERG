# Pre-production Reviewer

**Job Family:** JF-SECENG — Security Engineering
**Job Level Range:** L1-L4 (CERG Grade S1-S4)
**CERG Canonical Role:** Pre-production Reviewer (OM-001 §6.1)

---

## 1. Role Summary

The Pre-production Reviewer is a rotated Engineering role, not a permanent position. They own the pre-production checklist and sign off on go-live readiness: confirming that pre-production findings are remediated or risk-accepted, that handoff documentation is complete, and that the team inheriting the system knows its security posture. The role rotates among qualified Engineers to ensure cross-training and to prevent any single person from becoming a go-live bottleneck.

| Track | SME |

## 4. Key Responsibilities

### 4.1 Core Responsibilities (All Grades)

- Own and maintain the pre-production review checklist, keeping it current with evolving standards and threat landscape - Conduct pre-production reviews for systems approaching go-live: verify that architecture review findings are closed, vulnerability scans are clean or accepted, threat model findings are resolved, and handoff documentation is complete - Sign off on go-live readiness, confirming that the system meets the security bar defined in the Architecture Review Procedure - Escalate unresolved pre-production findings to the Engineering Pillar Leader and the project's Executive Sponsor - Ensure the post-go-live operations team receives a complete security handoff package: known risks, accepted findings, monitoring requirements, incident response contacts, and configuration documentation - Coordinate with Risk to confirm that pre-production vulnerability scans and adversarial testing results meet the defined bar - Coordinate with Governance to confirm that compliance-required evidence is collected before go-live

### 4.2 Grade-Level Responsibility Differentiation

Grade-level responsibility differentiation for this role is defined in [JA-001 §7](../../governance/CERG-GOV-JA-001_Job_Architecture_and_Grade_Framework.md) (Role-to-Grade Mapping). The grade definitions (S1-S4 SME Track, M1-M4 Management Track) and leveling dimensions are in JA-001 §4-5. Behavioral anchors at each grade are in [CMP-001](../../governance/CERG-GOV-CMP-001_Competency_Model_and_Behavioral_Anchors.md).

## 5. Required Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSAs)

### 5.1 Domain Expertise

- Broad cybersecurity engineering knowledge across multiple domains (cloud, identity, application, endpoint) - Deep familiarity with the CERG Architecture Review Procedure and pre-production review process - Ability to evaluate security findings in context: what is truly blocking versus what can be accepted and tracked - Strong written communication: the pre-production review sign-off is a durable record that may be reviewed by auditors - Sufficient seniority to push back on project pressure to go live with unresolved material findings

### 5.2 Technical Skills

Technical skills for this role are documented in the original JD-001 content extracted into this file (see §5.1 Domain Expertise). Additional technical skill definitions aligned to NICE Skill Statements are maintained in [JF-002](../CERG-GOV-JF-002_NICE_Workforce_Framework_Crosswalk.md).
