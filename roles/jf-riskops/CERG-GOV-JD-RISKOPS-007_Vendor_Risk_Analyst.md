# Vendor Risk Analyst

**Job Family:** JF-RISKOPS — Risk Operations
**Job Level Range:** L1-L4 (CERG Grade S1-S4/M3)
**CERG Canonical Role:** Vendor Risk Analyst (OM-001 §6.1)

---

## 1. Role Summary

The Detection Engineer owns detection-rule authoring, MITRE ATT&CK coverage, and the detection tuning lifecycle. They turn threat intelligence, vulnerability data, and red team findings into detection content that finds adversaries before the adversary achieves their objective. They are the bridge between knowing what threats exist and being able to see them in the environment.
